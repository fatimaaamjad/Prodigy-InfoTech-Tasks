🔒 Password Strength Checker (Python GUI)
📘 Overview

This project is a Password Complexity Checker built using Python and Tkinter.
It allows users to test the strength of their passwords in real-time through a simple and user-friendly graphical interface.
The program analyzes a password based on multiple criteria such as length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols — then provides feedback on how to improve it.
